# How to get started on contributing

When contributing to this project please consider discussing the changes you wish to make, you can do this via our [issue boards](https://gitlab.com/skillcamp/skillcamp.io/issues) or in our [Slack](skillcamp-io.slack.com) channel. If you have a feature request, a bug to report, or an idea, feel free to open an issue on the issue board.

We welcome everyone to our Slack channel, it's a great place to introduce yourself and to meet everyone that's currently contributing to various projects within Skill Camp. Come in, ask quesions, brainstorm ideas for a new project, and get people collaborating!

Please note that we have a Code of Conduct, please follow it when interacting with the projects hosted by Skill Camp!

## Merge Request Process

1.  Once you have found or opened an issue you would like to work on, either assign yourself or request to be assigned to the issue. This will let others know you're working on it.

2.  After cloning the repository, please make sure you are working from the latest version. Create your own branch and then begin working on your contribution. We encourage you to follow the naming convention `your-username/my-awesome-feature` when creating branches.

3.  To make sure your changes won't break the project run `npm test` to run the test suite.

4.  We request that commit messages start with a tag indicating its purpose. `fix:`, `doc:`, `chore:`, `feat:`, for example, this makes everything clearer in the Git history. You can optionally break down these into areas such as `feat(landing):`.

5.  When you are ready for feedback on your branch create a merge request on GitLab.

    > If you still have planned work to do on the branch add WIP: to the start of the merge request title to block it from being merged. Remove this tag when you are ready for your work to be look at in detail or are otherwise ready for it to be merged.

6.  Finally, once your code has been reviewed and approved, you will be able to merge your branch into the master!

## Style Guide

### Style

We follow the [AirBnB JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), please refer to repository for more information!

### Formatting

To maintain consistency within our projects we use [prettier](https://prettier.io/). We have added a pre-commit hook to automate this task for you. If you ever need to manually re-format run the command `npm pretty-quick`.
